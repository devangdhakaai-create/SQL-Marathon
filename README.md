# SQL-Marathon

SQL Practice & Projects — PostgreSQL

This repository documents my ongoing work in PostgreSQL, focused on learning real database concepts through structured assignments and problem-solving.

Covered so far

Practical Assignments

Schema design & normalization

Data insertion & modification

Integrity & constraints

Views, indexing & optimization

Stored procedures & transactions

Real-world database operations (export, restore, hierarchy, departments, salary analysis)

Each assignment emphasizes:

Data correctness

Transaction safety

Query clarity

Performance awareness

Current Stack

Database: PostgreSQL

Tools: psql / pgAdmin / pg_dump

Focus Areas: SQL fundamentals → intermediate DB operations → analytical querying

Upcoming Goals

Starting a 50-query path using LeetCode SQL to strengthen:

Window functions

Joins & subqueries

Aggregations

Ranking & analytics

Case handling & edge conditions

Why This Repo Exists

Build SQL depth via realistic database tasks

Document a transparent learning progression

Create a query portfolio that scales into data/analytics roles

Status

Actively updated until completion of the 50-query roadmap + advanced DB concepts.
